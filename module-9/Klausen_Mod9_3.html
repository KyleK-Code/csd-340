  <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

  <p>
    Life is often described as a great <span id="journey">_________</span>.  
    Along the way, we meet new people, learn new skills, and face experiences that shape who we are.  
    Each step teaches us something valuable that we carry forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    The beauty of life is in the <span id="discovery">_________</span>.  
    Every day brings something new—whether it’s a thought, a moment of joy, or a difficult lesson.  
    These discoveries make the journey meaningful and keep us moving forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, no story is complete without a <span id="challenge">_________</span>.  
    Challenges test our patience and resilience, but they also remind us of our strength.  
    When we rise to the moment, we often find ourselves closer to a well-earned <span id="victory">_________</span>.
