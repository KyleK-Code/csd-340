    <h2>Chapter 1: A Little About Me</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      I grew up in a split between the United States and Sweden. This meant that a normal weekend could mean dipping into my Swedish roots with traditional movies or dinners, or exploring the state of Florida with trips to the beach and going deep into the Everglades. I was always an athletic kid and loved playing every sport imaginable. 

    </p>

    <p>
      These days I split my time between retail management and studying software development. 
      The contrast actually helps, because managing a team keeps me grounded in real user needs, and coding gives me a structured way to solve problems. 
      <span class="sentence">I’m a big believer that clear structure beats raw speed when you’re learning new tools.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work and classes, I like trail runs, coffee that’s probably too strong, and playing video games late into the night. I also enjoy drawing sketches of ideas I have for websites. 
      I’m not an artist, but quick sketches help me think through layouts before touching the editor.
      When I finally move to the screen, I try to keep things simple and readable first, and fancy second.
    </p>

    <p>
      My current goals are to get sharper with HTML/CSS fundamentals and keep practicing clean commits to build good habits. 
      I’m also pushing myself to write more comments and small docs so future-me isn’t confused.
      Tiny improvements add up fast, especially when you’re juggling work, school, and life.
